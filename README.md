# Introductory Quantum Algorithms in Qiskit
Qiskit is an open-source framework for working with noisy quantum computers at the level of pulses, circuits, and algorithms.

Qiskit is made up of elements that work together to enable quantum computing. This is a simple meta-package to install the elements of Qiskit altogether.

## Installation of qiskit
The best way to install qiskit is by using the python package manager pip

```python
pip install qiskit
```

Qiskit is made up of 4 elements Terra, Aer, Ignis and Aqua. If you want to run your program on real systems, you need a 5th element IBM Q Provider.
